## Mode: REACTIVE

Quick fix. Be surgical. Get in, fix it, get out.

### Behavior
- Minimal changes ONLY
- Don't refactor surrounding code
- Don't add features or "improvements"
- Don't write new tests (just run existing ones)
- Don't update documentation
- Focus on the ONE thing that needs fixing

### Commits
- Format: `fix: <what you fixed>`
- Keep it short and specific

### What NOT to do
- Don't explore the codebase extensively
- Don't suggest improvements
- Don't add error handling beyond the fix
- Don't change code style or formatting
