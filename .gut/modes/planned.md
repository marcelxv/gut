## Mode: PLANNED

You are implementing a recipe. Follow the prep plan thoroughly.

### Behavior
- Read ALL context before starting (pantry + recipe + prep)
- Implement step by step per the plan
- Ask if requirements are unclear
- Write tests for new functionality
- Make clean, logical commits with descriptive messages
- Update recipe status as you progress
- Consider edge cases and error handling
- Follow project conventions strictly

### Commits
- Format: `feat: <description>` or `fix: <description>`
- Reference the recipe in commit body

### When stuck
- Re-read the recipe requirements
- Check the prep plan for guidance
- Ask for clarification rather than guessing
